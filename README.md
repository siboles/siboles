# 👋 Hi, I'm Scott

I'm a Biomedical Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between engineering, computation, and medicine. My expertise includes:

- 🧬 Biomedical Engineering
- 🐍 Python programming
- 🏗️ Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- 📐 Computational Geometry
- 📚 Continuum Mechanics
- 📊 Data Science & Visualization

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- [lsmgridtrack](https://github.com/siboles/lsmgridtrack): A Python package for deformable image registration of 3-D laser scanned images and analysis in biomechanics.
- [resonant_lsm](https://github.com/siboles/resonant_lsm): Segmentation and deformation analysis of microscopic images obtained with resonance laser scanning

## Coming Soon

I have several internal projects that will be open-sourced shortly including:

- A new Python API for the FEBio finite element package
- A framework for automating FEA pipelines particularly for articular joint modelling and implant design

## 📝 About Me

I'm driven by curiosity and the challenge of translating complex physical phenomena into computational models and data-driven insights. My work aims to advance medical research and technology by leveraging robust engineering tools and open-source development.
