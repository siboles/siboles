# 👋 Hi, I'm Scott

I'm a Biomedical Engineer that researches orthopedic mechanics. I utilize computational modeling and simulation to explore these mechanics
at the celluar, tissue, and joint (organ) scales. I have also developed tools to process, segment, and register 3-D images of articular
cartilage obtained with laser scanning microscopy under varying mechanical conditions.

My expertise includes:

- 🧬 Biomedical Engineering
- 🐍 Python programming
- 🏗️ Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- 📐 Computational Geometry
- 📚 Continuum Mechanics
- 📊 Data Science & Visualization
- 🖼️ Image Processing, Segmentation, and Registration
- :dart: Numerical Optimization, Sensitivity Analysis, and Uncertainty Quantification

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- [lsmgridtrack](https://github.com/siboles/lsmgridtrack): A Python package for deformable image registration of 3-D laser scanned images and analysis in biomechanics.
- [resonant_lsm](https://github.com/siboles/resonant_lsm): Segmentation and deformation analysis of microscopic images obtained with resonance laser scanning
- [bioMultiScale](https://github.com/siboles/bioMultiScale): A Python package for automating multiscale (submodeling) finite element analysis in articular cartilage
- [pyfebio](https://github.com/CompOrthoBiomech/pyfebio): A Python API for the FEBio finite element solver
  
## Coming Soon

I have several internal projects that will be open-sourced shortly including:

- A framework for automating FEA pipelines particularly for articular joint modelling and implant design
